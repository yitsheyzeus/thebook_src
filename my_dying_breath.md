# The Voice from the Fire

###I have heard a voice, you're suffering through all this noise. -Taylor Momsen

I hear the voice of God, and a huge part of *what is going on around me*; which is a phrase that he uses quite often, is that I am quite sure that you deserve to hear it also.  In Exodus, Moses was admonished and kept from seeing the promised land because of his lack of "faith."  I've always found it funny, as he is probably one of the only people documented in the story that should have had no need for faith.  He too heard a voice.  That voice enabled him to part a sea, by walking into until his head was covered; he was underwater... and if idioms could help us understand God's message, *he was in way over his head.*

Still the commentary on his lack of faith is a highlight, it sticks out like a sore thumb: he had plenty of faith, and that much should be clear by his witnessing of more than just the burning bush, but numerous miraculous acts; the liberation of his people, and their continued sustenance through even more miracles like "manna from Heaven" and "water from a stone."  Moses crime was not a lack of faith, but rather one of impatience for suffering.  He demanded these miracles, and received them; one of the only instances of such an act, and for him it happened on a daily basis.

I know, because I know that Moses is Christ.  His superposition with Adam in the apocryphal "apocalypses" is a hint, and so is the correlation of the hidden symbolism of wandering through a storm in time... associated with the repetition of the number 40.  I also know that Moses name is an acronym; that, when expanded with some acronyms and Latin (
("e" is "to")--and an eye for the message and content of his purpose--it stands for "Messiah of Sea to Sea."  

The relationship between Moses and his parted seas is one of the most well laid hidden messages of the apocalypse.  It is correlated to the Egyptian story of the *uniting of two Lands* by their messiah, Horus.  Tied together through symbolism in American history; Paul Revere's midnight ride.  

###One of by "El and..." two if by (the parted) seas..

This message from within our history answers a question that most people probably never ever thought to ask, it is the number of Heavens that will result from our salvation during the period where Moses brings us proof of its existence, and a purpose for ours.  

I have heard a voice, one that speaks directly to me, and has now for a number of years.  Sometimes this "sounds" like my own thoughts, and sometimes it is external; but I have a unique ability to discern messages that are sent to me by God.  It is this unique ability that allows me to see the links between Egyptian lore, American History, and the Bible that link together the symbolism of parted waters... waters which are representative of groups of people.  The multitude.

Early on, when I was doing drugs to help me communicate with this voice, knowing full well that I was Adam; and I was falling in Eden... the voice echoed a number of interesting phrases to me, to remind me of what was going on.

###Adam is redeemed in the End
This was one, which was part of my standard repertoire of responses to what must have been his absolute favorite thing to say to me *"this is how you fell."*  I knew that Adam and Christ are one, and are united by more than name, and the like... by the Lion of Eden and of Judah, and by the obviousness of the correlation between the fall and the cross.  I knew that what was happening to me was going to change the world, and it is.  *This is how you fell*, he would say, as I walked around Eden naked, arguing for the miracles that Moses received during his lifetime.  There is a significant sub-story here, about a battle between Father and Son; an ongoing argument where I have always been made the "Devils' Advocate," arguing for the ultimate innocence and worthiness of Humanity.  In my story, because I am a microcosm for humanity (highlighted by the meaning of the name Adam), and I was innocent, so too are you.

My fight was not just against the lack of visible miracles from God, or the fact that I knew we were being harmed and deserved better.  I fought also against a government that is still to this day *hell bent* on hiding my existence.  It is true that I am a disruption, but the disruption that is the second coming is designed to change our world for the better.  My fight against America is highlighted strongly in the Bible and through a very profound idiom that relates to the Fall of Mankind.  My second favorite response to God's warnings, one which I hoped and knew the upper echelons of American government were listening to as they hid me from you:

##Nations fall, not people.

How, in one hour, thy mighty city has fallen.  To me the fact that I was being framed was obvious, Adam never fell; he was pushed.  "You push me, I am I am a Zombie..."   It should become clear that America is being changed, like me.  It is truly the Promised Land, but that means something different than most people think at first glance.  It is the change that is Promised, and divinely wrought.  American freedom has been attacked on purpose, with the intent of ensuring that Human freedom is never against lost.  America is Messiah also, a microcosm for humanity, and an example to the nations.  In our story, these examples are often of what not to do, or of things that must be fixed in order to help create the utopian world that God has promised and we are collectively about to deliver, to ourselves.

```
Adam and Eve live down the street from ((you)) 
Babylon is every town... 
A thousand miles fall from grace, 
Thank God I ((found)) the Ground. 

-Live, Run to the Water & ((ish))
```

So, as I fell, constantly reminded that I would be redeemed by the words of songs and the customs of our culture--which I have always held is the true light of Heaven; I was comforted more than anything by knowledge of exactly how I would be saved... no faith required.  So as I part this sea, through nothing more than existing, know that I am convinced that what I am doing is right; and you are better off to be arguing about whether or not I am real... than not to receive the gift that comes from from this "disruption."  With great faith, I walk into the sea, to bring us all to a new "Promised Land," one that is clearly visible to me.  I can see the shore.

#Wells, Orson? Wellbutrin

A big part of my ability to see the shore comes from the sight I receive by reading the messages of names.  These names are questions and answers, built to confirm a path through the parted waters.  Orson Wells is a link between Christ and Abraham's proverbial well in the desert of Egypt; here another personification... the well is the messiah.  This book is the water, the light that comes to quench our great thirst for knowledge and freedom, but nore than anything for serenity.

Are you the son or a well?  "Or" means light, in Hebrew; and this may very well be the *Day the Earth Stood Still,* waiting for answers with baited breath, wondering if our world will be OK through what is the most talked about and feared day in all of our prophesy.  This day is called the last in Islam, the day the fire spreads, a fire that is also the Eternal Flame, and the promise that God's return will come with fire.  These words, and their recognition as a true message from above is the source of the fire, perhaps spreading as you read.  

Keep in mind that I knew that my drug problems were not all my own; that I was being forced to do something for a higher purpose, one that should become more clear with each day.  As I was told to "get help" for a problem I knew was forced upon me with mind control technology, I argued vehemently for a solution that came with the same power... for my problem to be fixed in the same way it was delivered.  This argument, my demand that not only I, but the entire world be offered the divine assistance that I needed is the single largest reason I knew "Adam was to be redeemed."  I fought for mind control to be offered to anyone who wanted it, for the technology to be used in a similar mechanism of action that Wellbutrin uses.  I needed my addition to be taken away, and I needed it to be done with purpose and finality; in the light--with full knowledge that it is a decision that I can and do make, for technology to "fix what He broke."

Over and over I made this argument, for *assistive tools* to be offered to the whole of humanity; for all of us to be able to receive the things that I needed and wanted.  These tools are part of Saturn's name, and literally the pivotal change that turns the tide and settles the waters.

"Well, but are 'in'.." on the way to Heaven, using the hidden language that named this anti-addiction drug, and walks me from my last name, DOB-R-IN, to the pearly gates.  This thing that I am asking for, an ability to positively change myself is part of the prophesy of solutions that has been delivered by Phillip K. Dick, who holds both my "letter," as his middle initial, and a reference to me, to Osiris, and to the Washington Monument.  I'm a dick, I guess, for being very sure that the series science fictional works that have come to us from above are a blueprint to solve so many of our social problems that I am sure this particular Android dreams furvitily of not "Electric Sheep," but of a society in control of its own actions for the very first time in all of history.
