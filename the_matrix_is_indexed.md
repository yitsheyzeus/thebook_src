##two letter keys

###ad
[Gracing the time line with my initials, ADonIS, ADonAi, ADvent, and more.](im_single.html)  IS of course, is god-shorthand for "I'm Single."

###ha
It means "the" in Hebrew, and is used as a superlative which connotes a meaning of "holy."  It is the two letters donated to Abraham's name upon his Covenant with God; as well as a reference to the English meaning of his son's name:  Isaac is "he laughs."

In the name "Elisha" we see a direct equality between Spanish and English, one which combines with the names Jeshurun and Jesus to become a Rosetta Stone that clearly shows foreknowledge of English and Spanish within these names.  Read [*The Tower of Babel*](the_tower_of_babel.html).  This particular teaching is allegorically described in the NT as the feeding of the masses by Jesus, with two fish--often described as being the prophets Elisha and Elija--it is about their names, and the "ha" and "ja" (both the same, in different cultures) that is laughter.

###ry

##[Run, Ran, Lamb and Lam.](the_lamb_of_god.html)
Iran, well... I suppose we Koran.  ImRan because of it, and that's the story of how I found out the *"Lamb of God"* isLam.  It's all about a Revelation received *on the run*, even Metroid's Sammas Aran agrees, famous cheat code: "Justin Bailey."
