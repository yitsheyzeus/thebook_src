##two letter keys

###ad
###ha
It means "the" in Hebrew, and is used as a superlative which connotes a meaning of "holy."  It is the two letters donated to Abraham's name upon his Covenant with God; as well as a reference to the English meaning of his son's name:  Isaac is "he laughs."

In the name "Elisha" we see a direct equality between Spanish and English, one which combines with the names Jeshurun and Jesus to become a Rosetta Stone that clearly shows foreknowledge of English and Spanish within these names.  Read [*The Tower of Babel*](the_tower_of_babel.html).  This particular teaching is allegorically described in the NT as the feeding of the masses by Jesus, with two fish--often described as being the prophets Elisha and Elija--it is about their names, and the "ha" and "ja" (both the same, in different cultures) that is laughter.

###ph
Relating directly to Pharoah, Pharisees, Phillistines, and Christopher Clumbus, this two letter key stands for "Pursuit of Happiness."
