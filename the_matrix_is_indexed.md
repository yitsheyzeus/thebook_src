##words read in reverse
###lot
In relation to the band *tool*, ["Yankee Doodle" in *The Tower of Babel*](the_tower_of_babel.html#TOOL), to Lot's Wife in "The Consort of El" in [*He laughs, again*](hamd.md/he_laughs.html#SALT).

###rod
To The Doors in [*Music Saves All Souls*](music_saves_all_souls.html), the Iron Rod of Christ in [*The Sang Rael*](holy_water,_sang_rael.html)

###yad
The hand of God, that's the answer to ["why A.D.?"](the_letter_why.html)

###exodus
 “sudo xe” is the logical equivalent of “ Let there be Light.” [Exodus in reverse;](behold,_the_burning_bush.html#LIGHT) in Linux and chemistry. It's my native "Geek," to be "tongue in cheek." 
 
###dog
*I've got to get Sirius.*

##two letter keys

###ad
[Gracing the time line with my initials, ADonIS, ADonAi, ADvent, and more.](im_single.html)  IS of course, is god-shorthand for "I'm Single."

###us

###ha
It means "the" in Hebrew, and is used as a superlative which connotes a meaning of "holy."  It is the two letters donated to Abraham's name upon his Covenant with God; as well as a reference to the English meaning of his son's name:  Isaac is "he laughs."

In the name "Elisha" we see a direct equality between Spanish and English, one which combines with the names Jeshurun and Jesus to become a Rosetta Stone that clearly shows foreknowledge of English and Spanish within these names.  Read [*The Tower of Babel*](the_tower_of_babel.html).  This particular teaching is allegorically described in the NT as the feeding of the masses by Jesus, with two fish--often described as being the prophets Elisha and Elija--it is about their names, and the "ha" and "ja" (both the same, in different cultures) that is laughter.

###ph
Relating directly to Pharaoh, Pharisees, Philistines, and Christopher Columbus, this two letter key stands for "Pursuit of Happiness."

###ry
"Our why," it's the key to the first line of Genesis, and the [Holy Grail.](holy_water,_sang_rael.html) In the beginning, the Spirit of God, "SHE KIN AH" hovered over *the waters.*  Holy water is people, Eve is SHE, Kin is RY, and AH is ONE big human family.  All Humanity, ahh...

###sa
Melissa, Sa-turn/tan/n/vior/int

###ck
Kentucky, Yitshack, Calvin Klein (in Back to the Future) and Clark Kent (in Superman 1).  

###is
Israel, Elisha and Jesus, Ishmael, Ishtar, Isaac, Isa, Islam

###am
The "I AM" founds America in Exodus... about *freedom* granted through the "Amerigo" of Adam having to leave Eden.  This time, in this book... Amish, Amon-Ra, and Amoz show us how Holy the two letters "am" are to the Wizard of Oz living on a television show in Heaven... while he writes a book "ishing" the words of God out of the sounds of music and scripture.

##[Run, Ran, Lamb and Lam.](the_lamb_of_god.html)
Iran, well... I suppose we Koran.  ImRan because of it, and that's the story of how I found out the *"Lamb of God"* isLam.  It's all about a Revelation received *on the run*, even Metroid's Sammas Aran agrees, famous cheat code: "Justin Bailey."

##It's elementary, my dear What-son?
###Hg

##Chr(t), it's all about technology.
Between the [Lisp of Moses,](the_encl.html) the red eyes of Revelation, and the sound of rushing waters... everywhere I look I see euphemisms to modern day computing hidden in ancient scripture.  In the [function's CHAR of Eucharist, CHR of Christ,](the_letter_why.html) and even in the [Hardening of the Heart of Pharaoh](expect_the_unexpected.html), it's clear to me "why" the Hebrew pronunciation of Isaac is about "hacking."  [YitsHa'ck... and Clark Kent no more.](the_letter_why.html)
