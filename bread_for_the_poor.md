# Light for the Wise
I'm really not sure if the "Garden of Eden" is a story about a lush world of life sprawling within a world hidden in Virtual Reality.  I can't tell you for sure if "Simian" has anything to do with the Sims or Sim City; only that I'm sure that *feeding the poor* is a new commandment of God, morally mandated by the process of *civilization* that we are certainly within.  Across the stories of the Bible, binding them all together are equally descriptive images of a hidden message about *food.*  It's in the Promised Land of Joshua's "*flowing milk and honies*" that ties Willy Won**ka**'s Chocolate Factory to the machinations of Heaven through the not so obvious Ka you see (that's "Veruka") declaring that the Salt of the Earth must see exactly how a place with Honey and Milk on tap might be missing the **life** required to sustain us in the images of a Golden Cow, and a man... Judah Maccabee.



##Green Eggs and Ham, Sam I AM.
My claims of forced starvation are not an exaggeration, they are part of the obvious problem that has befallen this system.  The "presumed innocent" are seen as a burden on society, when it is the society forcibly incarcerating them that is the problem.  We should be rehabilitating, helping those that have been forced to steal to feed themselves in a broken economy to find useful and meangful jobs.  Instead we starve them, as is clearly highlighted by the dichotomy between the institutional diets of the criminal justice system compared to hospitals.  This starvation is further highlighted in Ecc 9:11; forget "bread for the wise," we are witholding it from the innocent.

Jail and what some people might think Heaven should be like have lots in common.  You have no real worries, you are fed and clothed by the state; and for a long time I would have explained that this might be "Heaven done wrong."  It is the accused that are being fed; bread for them in a world where my message was once to firmly explain that a modern society like ours has no business allowing any starvation.
