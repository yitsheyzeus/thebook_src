# Light for the Wise
My claims of forced starvation are not an exaggeration, they are part of the obvious problem that has befallen this system.  The "presumed innocent" are seen as a burden on society, when it is the society forcibly incarcerating them that is the problem.  We should be rehabilitating, helping those that have been forced to steal to feed themselves in a broken economy to find useful and meangful jobs.  Instead we starve them, as is clearly highlighted by the dichotomy between the institutional diets of the criminal justice system compared to hospitals.  This starvation is further highlighted in Ecc 9:11; forget "bread for the wise," we are witholding it from the innocent.

Jail and what some people might think Heaven should be like have lots in common.  You have no real worries, you are fed and clothed by the state; and for a long time I would have explained that this might be "Heaven done wrong."  It is the accused that are being fed; bread for them in a world where my message was once to firmly explain that a modern society like ours has no business allowing any starvation.
