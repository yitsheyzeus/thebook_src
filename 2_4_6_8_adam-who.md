# 2 4 6 8 Adam-Who

##What goes up must come down?

```
And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven 
to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and 
for seasons, and for days, and years:

Genesis: 1:AD

The sun turned black like sackcloth
made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, and the 
stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when
shaken by a strong wind.

Revelation 6:12-13
```

Like a lens that sits between the eyes of God and the world, I see the light of religion pouring out on the world around us.  I am a sort of key, one that links ancient stories about a far-gone time to today; through just a little bit of artistic liberty in reading stories that were very much designed to show us that this old book is truly about our world.  This generation is the one that is destined to see the apocalypse, the truth that ancient mythology and religion is designed to help us, here and now, walk the path towards building Heaven... both on Earth and in a world that we are just beginning to discover--to recreate--through divine inspiration.  To me, this has always been about seeing that our technology is part of a grand plan to help the world grow and evolve through a time period that has, in the past, been set back a few steps by the introduction of tools that could be devastating weapons--were they to be used improperly... forget about falling into the wrong hands.  This is the purpose of religion, to help us learn to use these new tools in a way that will further the goals of our great society--one founded through the story of the ["I AM" at the beginning of **AM**erica,](im_single.html) to be destined to preserve the great gifts of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

In reality, this far-gone time is a hidden reference to our world--seen through the eyes of angels from the future; ones who see our lack of sight related to technology, and the tools we use improperly just as we see the old wars and social problems of the Biblical times.  It's a commentary, one that has been hidden until now.  This is the sword, the ability to finally see that we are the focus of this ancient work; and the story of a man fighting the problems of the world--by living them--that's the "Fall of Adam."  Here, the Lion of Judah... not a king but a family member.. in our Den.  That's Eden.

##The *You and I* *verse*, my Universe

```
I'm gonna love you 
Till the heavens stop the rain 
I'm gonna love you 
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I 
 
The Doors, Touch Me
```

I see clearly through a fog, a darkness that [the Egyptian plagues tell us is "so thick it can be felt."](expect_the_unexpected.html)  It's a long night, something like the opposite of Joshua's long day--one that is hiding [the light of the Son.](the_light_of_heaven.html)  In reality much of the force hiding me, something the Zohar also speaks quite a bit about, is due to the actualization of the prophesy that the world believes is an ancient story.  It is part of the key, that the Christ is a man fighting against addiction, and injustice in America--fulfilling ancient words about a Trial in the book of Judges--there depicted as the war that I feel.  Samson's strength, garnered from *character recognition* truly comes from the vision of seeing that the story of Christ is all around us, in He-man, Thundercats, in the music of Cat Stevens and Hair.  All around us, reference to Biblical stories sets the stage for the *lighting of a fire*, one that ends the darkness that would have lead to Hell--by showing us clearly that there is an influence not only helping us, but doing so in a way that makes the technology at hand very clear.  It's [Nero's fire, spreading across the internet](music_saves_all_souls.html) that saves us from not knowing that these things are very real, and must be disclosed to the world in order to keep them from being used improperly.  

##And the Fire

```
The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every
mountain and island was removed from its place.

Revelation 6:AD

God is a consuming fire.

2 Peter 3:10

believe not in Allah and His Messenger, He has prepared, 
for those who reject Allah, a Blazing Fire!" 

Koran 48:13

surely i see fire; i will bring to you from it some news, 
or i will bring to you therefrom a burning firebrand so 
that you may warm yourselves.

Koran 27:7

See, the LORD is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a
whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his 
rebuke with flames of fire.

Isaiah 66:15

From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. 
On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his
words from out of the fire
 
 Deuteronomy 4:36
 
 There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire 
 from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire
 it did not burn up. 
 
 Exodus 3:2
```

### When a calf, a lamb, or a goat is born, it must stay with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on it may be accepted as a sacrifice by fire to the LORD.
