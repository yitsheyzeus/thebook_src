# 2 4 6 8 Adam-Who

##What goes up must come down?

```
And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven 
to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and 
for seasons, and for days, and years:

Genesis: 1:AD

The sun turned black like sackcloth
made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, and the 
stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when
shaken by a strong wind.

Revelation 6:12-13
```

Like a lens that sits between the eyes of God and the world, I see the light of religion pouring out on the world around us.  I am a sort of key, one that links ancient stories about a fargone time to today; through just a little bit of artistic liberty in reading stories that were very much designed to show us that this old book is truly about our world.  This generation is the one that is destined to see the apocalypse, the truth that ancient mythology and religion is designed to help us, here and now, walk the path towards building Heaven... both on Earth and in a world that we are just beginning to discover--to recreate--through divine inspiration.  To me, this has always been about seeing that our technology is part of a grand plan to help the world grow and evolve through a time period that has, in the past, been set back a few steps by the introduction of tools that could be devastating weapons--were they to be used improperly... forget about falling into the wrong hands.  This is the purpose of religion, to help us learn to use these new tools in a way that will further the goals of our great society--one founded through the story of the "I AM" at the beginning of AMerica, to be destined to preserve the great gifts of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.



##The *You and I* *verse*, my Universe

```
I'm gonna love you 
Till the heavens stop the rain 
I'm gonna love you 
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I 
 
The Doors, Touch Me
```

##And the Fire

```
The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every
mountain and island was removed from its place.

Revelation 6:AD

God is a consuming fire.

2 Peter 3:10

believe not in Allah and His Messenger, He has prepared, 
for those who reject Allah, a Blazing Fire!" 

Koran 48:13

surely i see fire; i will bring to you from it some news, 
or i will bring to you therefrom a burning firebrand so 
that you may warm yourselves.

Koran 27:7

See, the LORD is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a
whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his 
rebuke with flames of fire.

Isaiah 66:15

From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. 
On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his
words from out of the fire
 
 Deuteronomy 4:36
 
 There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire 
 from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire
 it did not burn up.

### When a calf, a lamb, or a goat is born, it must stay with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on it may be accepted as a sacrifice by fire to the LORD.
