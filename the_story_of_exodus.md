#Expect the Unexpected

I used to think that everything in religion was going to deliver us a map of a future past, that every story was a metaphor for a path away from the desert that was being stuck in one place and time with no hope to really reach *escape velocity.*  In this word the *water* that is Biblically related to the *coming of age* of Jacob and his crossing the river Jordan was about our collective need to pass through a barrier at sea--only... in space.  Through my period of awakening, one which took me from a little lion cub sleeping in a Jungle of madness to a man fighting desperately not to relive his past future... I experienced the lives of the past Horsemen of the Apocalypse through what I can best describe today as a waking dream.  I received story after story of exactly what happened the last time we left Earth, what we encountered and the ups and downs that ensued. 

It's almost as if I've experienced two complete phases of Revelation, one which began equating Biblical metaphor to science and technology... and another which clearly focused on *people*.  In these two conflicting tellings of *what is to come* there is no metaphor more perfect than that of *water* to explain just how perfectly our guide book to the future is written.

```
oh desert speak to my heart
oh woman of the earth
maker of children who weep for love
maker of this birth
'til your deepest secrets are known to me
I will not be moved

run to the water
and find me there
burnt to the core but not broken
we'll cut through the madness
of these streets below the moon
these streets below the moon

Live, Run to the Water
```

It was 2013, and I had just moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky with my ex-wife and very young son.
