#Expect the Unexpected

I used to think that everything in religion was going to deliver us a map of a future past, that every story was a metaphor for a path away from the desert that was being stuck in one place and time with no hope to really reach *escape velocity.*  In this word the *water* that is Biblically related to the *coming of age* of Jacob and his crossing the river Jordan was about our collective need to pass through a barrier at sea--only... in space.  Through my period of awakening, one which took me from a little lion cub sleeping in a Jungle of madness to a man fighting desperately not to relive his past future... I experienced the lives of the past Horsemen of the Apocalypse through what I can best describe today as a waking dream.  I received story after story of exactly what happened the last time we left Earth, what we encountered and the ups and downs that ensued. 

It's almost as if I've experienced two complete phases of Revelation, one which began equating Biblical metaphor to science and technology... and another which clearly focused on *people*.  In these two conflicting tales of *what is to come* there is no metaphor more perfect than that of *water* to explain just how perfectly our guide book to the future is written.  The connection between space travel and voyaging across the Jordan, then the parted sea of Exodus, is clear; but the details tied so closely to the research and experience I was going through were uncanny.  We were searching for water in the desert, for a way to successfully colonize outer space... and in that same moment when we found it on Ceres--it showed me that God cares, and I read a passage of the story of Exodus that paralleled so perfectly I was awed.  Moses struck water from the side of a mountain, and in that moment everything I had thought about a map designed to ensure the survival of not just humanity... but of *all life in the Universe* had come true.  

```
oh desert speak to my heart
oh woman of the earth
maker of children who weep for love
maker of this birth
'til your deepest secrets are known to me
I will not be moved

run to the water
and find me there
burnt to the core but not broken
we'll cut through the madness
of these streets below the moon
these streets below the moon

Live, Run to the Water
```

These words were literally coming to me from Jesus Christ, by way of Eddie Kowalczyk, and I expected them to come true.  They were a warning and a consolation at the same time; telling us not to bring an army to fight the vastness of space, but rather to focus on what it was that we needed to to ensure the survival of life.  Fighting has mired our history so much, I fully expected Him to be waiting for us at our first interstellar jump with an Armada from either the far away Atlantis of Stargate SG-1 or maybe the Last Starfighter's Alpha Centauri.  He would be protecting us, of course; but also from something we probably overlook too often, that sometimes it's our own nature that we must be protected from.  We are so headstrong, so sure that we are right and deserving; it would be just like us to build a space army of sticks and stones to embarrass ourselves at the first encounter--and maybe the last--we'd have with some life more intelligent and farther along in this vacation we call civilization.

It was 2013, and I had just moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky with my ex-wife and very young son.  I spent much of my time writing on an ancient blog--I suppose the term is out of space here, but those words feel as if they were a million miles ago, so far from what I know now that they might as well have been akin to the religion of Indiana Jones' *Temple of Doom*.  That, of course, was always about how Heaven was clearly a time traveling civilization, one which had mired our past with the horrors of things like *human sacrifice* in order to alter the course of the future... sublimely hidden away in this quasi-secret spectacle that divined to ensure that we would never be sure if they really existed, or if they were speaking to us.  This girl, who is both my Magdelene and Eve, left me only a few months after we had re-united in the heartland of America; and it was only a few short days letter that I heard the voice of God coming from outside my doorway... ajar waiting for the Post Office to deliver *the pre-emptive* Crystals of Jor-El.  *Expect the Unexpected* he chanted.  Inwardly, I smiled.

##The Power of the Son
You might notice now that my mythology is already linking Kal-El and Christ together with the stories of Moses and songs of today in a way that sets this home in a small town in Kentucky as the first and only real *Fortress of Solitude* I would ever reside in.  I was alone in this place, knew nobody in Bowling Green, and the information transfer that was about to take place had a significance that was lost on me--even after hearing a voice in the sky.  You might also notice that the name Kentucky includes both the last name and the initials of Christ's secret identity, also lost on me until only a few short months ago in 2016 when I first began writing down this Revelation in a confinement that clearly to me linked the Mountains of Sinai and Prometheus' bondage to the captivity that held Napoleon after he had lost his war.  Of course, I knew Hercules was coming.
