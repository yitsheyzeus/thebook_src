# God and the Big Bang

I suppose I've always taken solace in knowing that sometime *in the end* I would be redeemed.  The truth is I don't know this for sure, simply that I've had so much helpful information to share... and because it came to me in such a way that helping the world was my only choice.  I feel like I've fought very hard for you, and in return I've been given nothing but grief.  Today, in complaining about that, I seek to show you what it means for Adam to be redeemed.  I'm going to tell you how I really feel.  I'm reminded of a scene from the Princess Bride--I'm going to be honest (as I always am) because this... this is *for posterity.*  

## A girl tore my reality from me.

She did it by *kicking my heels*, she was re-enacting a scene from Eden... putting enmity between man and woman.  She probably didn't know that, she had no idea what she did to me in 2010.  Everything I thought I knew about the world was torn from me, I was plunged into a deep dark cave, a place where magic was real... where mind control and Hell were sprawled over the face of my Earth.  I had been normal, tortured in secret... even from myself, but normal none the less.  Then the Tribulation happened, and my old love came back to me to tear my heart apart; and that's what she did.  Genesis says that Adam blamed Eve... and for years I would have insisted that it was mind control that I blamed; but today... with her gone, and me filled with the *light of the world*, it's really her that I blame.  I blame her for not standing up to God with me; for being too weak to handle whatever it was that we had to go through together to bring truth the words of the Live song *They Stood Up for Love.*

It's ironic, because I'm probably doing the same thing to you... to the whole world.  I'm taking the thing we knew as reality away, but I do it for the right reasons, to preserve *the truth*--to ensure life is sustained--because I am saving us from a delusion.  I suppose she was saving me from the same delusion, from a world where I wanted nothing more than to blend in to the blur that is the sea of Adam.  She was trying to destroy me though, and I think deep down in my mind; that's exactly what she was sure she was doing.  

If I didn't know it was blame that destroyed the world... not water or fire... I wouldn't be so fixated on the part of the message that tells me that we shouldn't be looking for blame, instead we should be searching for who to thank for doing all the work behind the scenes for so long.  That's not our nature though, we don't see what's about to happen, only that something is changing, and change scares us.  Just like I had no choice, the world really doesn't either... we are being given a reason and a path to fix things that we didn't think were broken.  I suppose that causes some resent.  It's being forced on us, it's the Apocalypse... the truth will come no matter what.   In the end, it's right.
