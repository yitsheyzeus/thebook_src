# God and the Big Bang

I suppose I've always taken solace in knowing that sometime *in the end* I would be redeemed.  The truth is I don't know this for sure, simply that I've had so much helpful information to share... and because it came to me in such a way that helping the world was my only choice.  I feel like I've fought very hard for you, and in return I've been given nothing but grief.  Today, in complaining about that, I seek to show you what it means for Adam to be redeemed.  I'm going to tell you how I really feel.  I'm reminded of a scene from the Princess Bride--I'm going to be honest (as I always am) because this... this is *for posterity.*
