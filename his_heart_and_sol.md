Through the lyrics of rock and roll, He speaks a woven message that ties ancient scripture to modern music; and links history and *langolier* together with a message that takes a bit of thinking to grasp.  Once you take the time to see what is being said, or not overtly said the light of the Menorah of [Chanukah](hamd.md/he_laughs.html) sheds understanding on more than just this one concept, but on the whole of the Bible.

With this addition, it's clearly a question that echoes through history to the **S**ons **o**f **L**iberty, Men.. or **A**ll **H**umanity?
